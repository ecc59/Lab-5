# Lab-5-groupwork
*by Ellie Covitz and Johnny Kretzing*

This program asks the user for their middle name and then also asks the user for an integer.
If the integer is odd, then the program wil print that the integer is odd.
If the integer is even, then the program will print that the integer is even.
Lastly the program will print the middle name inputed. 

## Using Lab-5-groupwork
You will want to use this program in order to find out if an integer is either odd or even. When the prompt asks "What is your middle name", you should input a String of your middle name. When the prompt says "Input an integer:", you should input a whole number. Then the program will print the middle name inputed and whether the number is odd or even.


## How to Contribute
In order to contribute, simply make a fork of the repository and make changes to the Lab-5-Code.ipynb jupyter hub notebook. If possible, adding a use to the middle name would be great. For example, the program could possibly compute if the middle name has an odd or even amount of letters.
